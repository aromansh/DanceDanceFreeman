# Dance Dance Freeman

This is a POC that sends the input from a dance pad to a Half-Life process, so
that you can play the game with only your feet.

## Why?

I saw that many Youtubers were attempting to complete Half-Life using only one
hand. I asked my self "Is it possible to complete it without hands?". From that,
I hacked this tool that maps a dance pad to the Half-Life controls.
